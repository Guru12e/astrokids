        CANCELLATION AND REFUND POLICY
      </h1>

        <p>
          Since AstroKids is providing the User with an astrology report, which
          is an informational product for which our astrologers have already
          spent considerable time and effort – we would be unable to process any
          refunds on your purchase.
        </p>
        <p>
          While AstroKids will always try to ensure that each report is prepared
          carefully, however, because astrology is not an exact science and is
          based on interpretation of birth chart and astrological data and
          scientific calculations made thereon: (a) AstroKids reports should be
          considered solely as an opinion based on the principles of astrology;
          (b) AstroKids will not entertain any disputes related to User's
          comparison of AstroKids reports with any other astrologer or astrology
          website's interpretation or similar reports whatsoever.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because AstroKids reports are based on the predictive science of Vedic
          astrology and not based on any specific published almanac, AstroKids
          does not rule out the possibility of unexpected technical or human
          errors in its reports. In the event of any such error being notified
          by the User, AstroKids' liability will, at all times, be limited to
          the extent of making reasonable efforts in rectifying such error and
          providing the User with a corrected report.
